                    <p style="padding: 30px 0 10px 0; font-weight: 700;">Paul Cloutier</p>
                    <p>Paul Cloutier is a leader in designing businesses. As an entrepreneur–both on the client side and
                        the agency side–Paul has helped some of the world’s most effective brands bring experiences to
                        life.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>More often than not–after spending a great deal of time, money, and precious focus–a product or
                        service launch gets dropped into the world with a well advertised thud. All of the things were
                        done to ensure it’s success, the best designers and engineers, the consultancy that looked at
                        the market and talked to customers, but somehow, something was missed.</p>

                    <p>In many of these cases failure has come because we are designing for the parameters that we want
                        rather than the parameters that are actually there. Either we intentionally ignored details that
                        were inconvenient, or we didn’t have the data from the right people and places–we didn’t design
                        for reality, we designed for a fantasy that we wanted to be reality.</p>

                    <p>What is generally missing is a deep enough consideration of the parts that get left out of the
                        design process, a bringing together of people, and a full considered conversation rather than a
                        siloed set of separate discussions. The magic happens when we are all working, talking, and
                        brainstorming together with as much information as possible.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes these projects fail because product development is just not the core skillset of the
                        company, they don’t have the organizational readiness. The challenge though is that if you want
                        to operate in a modern service led world you have to have this skill as a core competency and
                        can’t hire it out forever. the miss from an agency standpoint is finding ways to monetize making
                        yourself irrelevant. many of these organizations have no skill at hiring designers or
                        strategists, they have no management capability to integrate them in ways that will keep those
                        creative workers happy, and most importantly they don’t have the executive resilience or design
                        maturity to do this work and so the product fails.</p>

                    <p>And this process isn’t just about getting the right people at the table, it is also reckoning
                        with the actual cost of things. Many times businesses suffer because they don’t realize how much
                        more things costs than what is advertised on the proposal. The design and engineering are just
                        the tip of the iceberg. Designing for reality means understanding these hidden costs, and
                        building them into your planning and operation. How many people will need to run it, how will
                        they be trained, how will you get them involved early enough that they don’t reject the
                        thinking. And of course this understanding the externalized costs means understanding the
                        downstream implications of your work, we can no longer afford to leave the impacts of our
                        decisions to the next generation</p>

                    <p>Consulting has worked to build processes of co-design, user centered thinking, and business
                        design to tangle with these issues, recognizing that product excellence comes not just from the
                        artifacts, but from how that product is operationalized into providing a good experience. The
                        general approach here has been making a bigger table to get more folks around it. This is an
                        admirable strategy but inherently unscalable, and requires an almost religious level of ongoing
                        dedication to the process on the part of the client, without any of the training and skillset to
                        do so.</p>

                    <p>Another challenge has often been that the consultancies and the client are often working at cross
                        purposes, and from different first principles–a divorce of corp strategy and product strategy.
                        The principles that are driving the product thinking quite often either ignore the business
                        realities, the customer realities, or the simple reality that people in a company don’t
                        generally like to be told what to do by outsiders. And on the client side, the principles
                        driving their decision making often have many other products and business lines to consider,
                        legal issues, shareholder management, training, ops, and so many other areas, that the product
                        decision making is left to more tactical layers of a company, making true strategic decision
                        making unlikely and myopic at best.</p>

                    <p>They answer for us has been purpose-led business thinking, what started as an extension of brand
                        experience–the alignment of all of your customer touch-points with your brand values–has led to
                        a more extended framework that takes into account your goals, values, mission and principles and
                        harnesses them for strategic business decision making.</p>

                    <p>This purpose led business thinking defines a companies purpose in an actionable format, it
                        understands the fundamentals of the business reality and the customer reality, while creating a
                        working framework that can give guidance at every step. This purpose led framework can inform
                        the brand strategy, the product strategy, the growth strategy, the operations strategy, and the
                        marketing strategy–theoretically everything a business needs to make a decision about.</p>

                    <strong>Turning the Tables</strong>

                    <p>What starts to become compelling about the changing nature of design and strategy consultancy is
                        the role that vast amounts of data can play. When we talk about designing with AI, of course
                        this means designing new types of interfaces for AI products, but much more importantly it means
                        infusing AI and LLMs and these new agents into our design processes. The new insights, the new
                        angles, the totality of information, the evolutionary strategies, the infinite iterations, all
                        will help us leapfrog the unwieldy process of “making a bigger and bigger table”</p>

                    <strong>A Note about Designing for Reality</strong>

                    <p>Designing for reality means taking everything that you can into consideration, working with all
                        of the parts of the organization, accounting for the actual, total costs of doing business, and
                        aligning your mission vision and values to what you actually do as a business. The alternative
                        to this is just going down a list of best practices checking boxes like a cargo cult, talking
                        about values without actually delivering on them, creating design artifacts that never move
                        beyond dropbox or a local staging server.</p>

                    <p>There are several key ingredients that we are working with here:</p>

                    <h3>01. <br>Collaboration</h3>
                    <p>The fullness of communi-cation, of bringing people together, of bringing the right people
                        together, of building teams that are right for the project, of finding perspectives that are
                        often ignored or left out of the process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-item">
                    <h3>02.<br>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Understanding why we are doing what we are doing and finding ways to drive that purpose through
                        every aspect of the org, finding ways to make sure we deliver of the promise we have made, and
                        recognizing that that purpose gives you permission to enter new and interesting areas.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-item">
                    <h3>03.<br>AI as a design process</h3>
                    <p>LLMs, computational creativity, and simulated Agents can provide hidden insights, evolutionary
                        prototyping, mass customization, and asset generation, unlocking totally new approaches that
                        weren’t available previously. </p>
                        <p>A big part of understanding systems thinking is seeing the hidden connections and this is where
                        we use data and agents to make that system more visible and workable.</p>

                    <h3>04.<br> Craft</h3>
                    <p>Probably worth noting craft as a component as well considering who we are and where we come from.
                        We aren’t just thinkers, we are also makers, we can bring things to life. The awareness of how
                        things are made and the mastery of the tools gives us an encyclopedic knowledge of possibilities
                        and approaches.</p>

                    <strong>A Note About Regenerative Design</strong>

                    <p>This direction isn’t about shifting away from regenerative design per se, it's about sharpening
                        the offer and putting its value in the right place. One of the stated concerns about the
                        positioning of Regenerative is that it places us in a tier of the org that often has less money,
                        less power, and regularly working on projects that have a high potential for greenwashing.</p>

                    <p>The new approach that we are working on places regenerative design as a core capability of how we
                        work, rather than as a market segment. Regardless of the client and regardless of their
                        enthusiasm, we can layer this more holistic approach into our work. One of the key ways we can
                        do this is through the full accounting of external costs on our projects. as a key part of our
                        framework we can help explore energy costs, people costs, work style, location, materials and
                        many other aspects and possibly have more of an impact than we might if we came in the front
                        door trumpeting our regenerative bonafides.</p>

                    <p>This also doesn’t preclude us from targeting climate, energy, or human scale projects, these can
                        still be verticals and market segments we target and develop thought leadership in.</p>
