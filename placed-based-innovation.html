            <section class="focus-text">
                <p>We're fascinated by how innovation can transform communities, cities, and regions. Place-based
                    innovation is about developing solutions that are tailored to the unique characteristics,
                    challenges, and opportunities of specific locations. It's an approach that's gaining traction
                    globally, and for good reason.
                </p>
            </section>



            <section>
                <div id="center-text">
                    <p class="body-Copy-Title" style="color: #BB3216;">Why Place-based Innovation Matters</p>
                    <p>Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches to development often fall short because they don't
                        account for local nuances. Place-based innovation, on the other hand, leverages local knowledge,
                        resources, and networks to create more effective and sustainable solutions.<br><br>
                        The impact of this approach can be significant. According to the European Commission's 2021
                        Regional Innovation Scoreboard, regions implementing place-based innovation strategies have
                        experienced, on average, 2.3% higher annual GDP growth compared to regions without such
                        strategies. While this might seem like a small number, in terms of economic growth, it's
                        substantial and can translate to meaningful improvements in people's lives.<br><br>
                        But here's the kicker: global investment in place-based innovation initiatives has grown from
                        $12 billion in 2015 to $47 billion in 2022 - a nearly 300% increase, according to McKinsey &
                        Company. If you're not already thinking about place-based innovation, you might be falling
                        behind.</p>

                        <p class="body-copy" style="min-width: 250px;">We help bring together diverse stakeholders to
                            create systems-wide
                            collaboration. This is increasingly important - and increasingly challenging. The United
                            Nations' 2022 World Cities Report notes that the number of formal multi-stakeholder
                            partnerships in urban governance has increased by 63% globally between 2015 and 2022.</p>
                        <p class="body-copy" style="min-width: 250px;">These partnerships are crucial for addressing
                            complex challenges that no
                            single entity can solve alone. But let's be honest: dealing with multiple stakeholders, each
                            with their own goals and communication styles, can be a real pain. We've got experience
                            navigating these complex environments and helping everyone work towards common goals.</p>

                        showcase a region's unique attributes.</p>

                        the potential for innovation in rural areas. There's often unexpected manufacturing capability
                        and creative talent in these places. For young, ambitious people, rural areas can offer unique
                        opportunities to make a significant impact.</p>

                    <p>As we continue to grapple with complex global challenges - from climate change to social inequality - the importance of place-based innovation is likely to grow. We're committed to staying at the forefront of this field, constantly refining our approaches and learning from each project we undertake.<br><br>
                        We believe that by harnessing local knowledge and resources, and combining them with global insights and cutting-edge methodologies, we can help create more resilient, prosperous, and sustainable places. Whether you're a city planner, a regional development agency, or a business looking to make a positive impact in your community, we'd be glad to explore how place-based innovation might help you achieve your goals.<br><br>
                        Remember, the key is to start. As we like to say, showing up and doing the work is really the solution. Let's get started.</p>
