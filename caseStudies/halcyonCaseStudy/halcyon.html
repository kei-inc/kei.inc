                                    Deploying that money is a capital markets challenge, but it is also a technical,

                            <p>Halcyon was founded in April 2023 by Bruce Falck, former head of Twitter's ad team. His
                                journey from building "incredible machines to serve ads" to serving the planet began
                                with a desire to make a positive impact. A conversation with Andrew Beebe at Obvious
                                Ventures, known for its "world positive investing," set Falck on the path that led to
                                Halcyon's creation.<br><br>
                                Initially exploring carbon trading markets, Falck's direction shifted after conducting
                                over 100 customer interviews. He identified a critical need: organizations were
                                struggling to navigate the energy transition efficiently.

                                The energy sector is laden with complexities. Professionals spend considerable time
                                sifting through vast amounts of regulatory and market data to make informed decisions.
                                Nat Bullard articulates the problem: <em>"Today's information landscape is opaque,
                                    fragmented, noisy, and ever-expanding. That is a source of intense frustration for
                                    any analyst in a strategy or policy role. But with emerging artificial intelligence
                                    capabilities, it is also an opportunity."</em><br><br>
                                Falck emphasizes the potential impact: <em>"If we can help someone get to a good answer
                                    in two hours versus two days or two weeks, that's going to have a huge impact. The
                                    way I think about it is we're removing sand from the gears."</em><br><br>
                                Kei's involvement was instrumental in Halcyon's early development. Our team explored
                                concepts, created prototype product sketches, defined potential value propositions,
                                conducted market research and competitive analysis, and identified key pain points and
                                opportunities for potential customers.<br><br>
                                Reflecting on this phase, Falck notes;

                                Securing investment was a critical early milestone for Halcyon. Kei worked closely with
                                the team to shape the product vision and create a compelling investor narrative. We
                                developed user personas, market analysis, competitive landscape overviews, and custom
                                data visualizations.<br><br>
                                This collaborative effort resulted in Halcyon securing $10 million in seed funding,
                                providing the resources needed to turn the concept into reality.

                                Artificial intelligence plays a central role in Halcyon's offerings. The company employs
                                large language models (LLMs) and generative AI to process and interpret vast amounts of
                                unstructured data.<br><br>
                                Bullard explains in a blog post, <em>"LLMs allow us to ask questions and get responses
                                    in human language. They make our work happen in a way that it could not before,
                                    allowing us to do something with software that would have been extremely expensive
                                    or impossible to do only with humans."</em><br><br>
                                Halcyon goes beyond basic AI use, using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
                                LLMs in specific knowledge areas, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses.
                                This technique is crucial for dealing with specialized areas such as regulatory policies
                                and energy transition information.<br><br>

                                felt familiar but provided UI for a completely new type of information retrieval system.
                                We needed to provide industry experts with a high degree of information scan-ability and

                                Our goal was to establish Halcyon as the trusted technology partner and leading
