                            <p>California's forests were at a critical juncture. In 2020 alone, wildfires resulted in staggering losses:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>$3-4 trillion in ecosystem benefit losses at current market valuation</li>
                                <li>$63 billion in public health impacts</li>
                                <li>$2.3 billion in fire suppression costs</li>
                                <li>20 years of lost profitability for the insurance industry due to structure damage and loss</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With the potential loss of a large portion of California's forests looming in the next 15-20 years, urgent action was needed. However, the complexity of the issue demanded a nuanced approach. Not all fires are detrimental, and not every tree contributes positively to forest health. The consequences of inaction were dire: increased mass mortality, severe climate impacts, water scarcity, disruption of California's food system, and significant threats to human health.</p>
                            <p>The challenges were multifaceted:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fragmented data and decision-making processes across numerous agencies and stakeholders</li>
                                <li>Lack of real-time, high-resolution data on forest health and fire risk</li>
                                <li>Slow and cumbersome planning processes for forest management projects</li>
                                <li>Difficulty in visualizing and communicating complex forest management scenarios</li>
                                <li>Balancing multiple objectives like fire risk reduction, habitat preservation, and carbon sequestration</li>

                            <p>Today’s intense, destructive, and costly wildfires are driven by unnaturally dense forests, expanded development in fire-prone areas, and climate change, which has dried out vegetation, extended the fire season, and led to pest outbreaks that have killed millions of trees across the western U.S.</p>
                            <p>In California in 2020 alone, wildfires resulted in:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>$3-4 trillion in ecosystem benefit losses at today’s market valuation, including carbon emissions and loss of carbon sequestration, water quality, recreation, and wood products</li>
                                <li>$63 billion in public health impacts</li>
                                <li>$2.3 billion in fire suppression costs</li>
                                <li>20 years of lost profitability for the insurance industry due to structure damage and loss.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With the potential loss of a large portion of California's forests in the next 15-20 years, it is crucial that we take action to restore them.</p>
                            <p>But the issue is complex – not all fires are bad and not all trees are good.</p>
                            <p>The consequences of inaction are dire: increased mass mortality, severe impacts on the climate, water scarcity, disruption of the California food system, and a significant threat to human health. To address the matter, it is necessary to engage policymakers, industries, funders, and the general public.</p>
                            <p>Our initial over-arching goal for this endeavor was to find ways to help increase the pace and scale of forest restoration in California (and eventually, the rest of the world). Our initial thinking about how we might achieve this task was to combine state-of-the-art spatial data (LIDAR), ultra-high-resolution satellite data, and user-friendly interfaces to make sense of the data. Although not incorrect, the needs were actually much more profound.</p>

                            <p>We conducted over 100 interviews, contextual inquiries, and co-design sessions across a broad cross-section of governmental, scientific, industry, land management, and emergency communities. Participants included land managers at the US Forest Service, The Nature Conservancy, Calfire’s top management, and scientists with expertise in forest ecology, wildfire, hydrology, wildlife habitat, and meteorology.</p>

                            <p>What we began to understand is that there is a fundamental need for dynamic, scalable, synchronous data and decision making at every scale. Our revised goal was morphing to include guiding alignment across agencies, organizations, and the entire range of stakeholders – from government officials down to individual homeowners.</p>
                            <p>At different scales, the issues, stakeholders, timelines, budgets, visibility, and processes shift. Addressing these differences and varying needs at the UI and data visualization layers pose interesting challenges.</p>

                            <p>During our collaboration with the US Forest Service, we discovered that a diverse multi-agency team of scientists, land managers, and policy makers had been collaborating for years to develop a conceptual framework for resilience. The team aimed to provide a comprehensive perspective on land management that considered a range of desired benefits stemming from resilient socio-ecological systems. As part of their efforts, they identified ten key landscape outcomes, referred to as the "pillars of resilience".</p>
                            <p>The metrics underlying this framework are extensive, interconnected, and profound. We collaborated with their team to extend the thinking into our Elemental decision support system. We additionally incorporated the framework by co-developing a 'resilience scorecard' that users can employ to evaluate landscape metrics at multiple scales.</p>
                            <p>We created this visualization to help people understand the framework 'at-a-glance'. The visualization is also currently in use by the USFS.</p>

                            <p>The Prioritization area is comprised of three areas:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The <strong>Objectives</strong> area allows users and teams to create and refine objectives for the Area Of Interest.</li>
                                <li><strong>Decision Spaces</strong> shows users the areas where management decisions are most needed on the map.</li>
                                <li>The <strong>Benefit Optimization</strong> functionality allows for individual benefits to be dialed up and down and shows what trade-offs might need to be made as a result.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the objectives area, stakeholders are able to 'force rank' priorities for an AOI. The Elemental system uses artificial intelligence (and / or policy-based directives) to create an initial set of objectives based on a set of ecologically sound principles combined with an automatic analysis of the landscape. Team members can then 'drag' priorities up or down to better suit their specific circumstances or mandates.</p>

                            <p>The first major customer installation is in the Lake Tahoe Basin.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>“Land Tender will be used in the Tahoe Basin and surrounding critical watersheds covering 1.5 million acres, making this the largest deployment to date of this new system. The platform will be deployed across the Lake Tahoe Basin, the Middle Truckee River, American River, Bear River, Feather River, and Yuba River watersheds. Much of that area is either burning, under high wildfire threat, or in need of reforestation, fueling the need for faster, more informed wildfire resilience and restoration planning and monitoring“.</p>

                                <p>Today’s intense, destructive, and costly wildfires are driven by unnaturally dense forests, expanded development in fire-prone areas, and climate change, which has dried out vegetation, extended the fire season, and led to pest outbreaks that have killed millions of trees across the western U.S.</p>
                                <p>In California in 2020 alone, wildfires resulted in:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>$3-4 trillion in ecosystem benefit losses at today’s market valuation, including carbon emissions and loss of carbon sequestration, water quality, recreation, and wood products</li>
                                    <li>$63 billion in public health impacts</li>
                                    <li>$2.3 billion in fire suppression costs</li>
                                    <li>20 years of lost profitability for the insurance industry due to structure damage and loss.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>With the potential loss of a large portion of California's forests in the next 15-20 years, it is crucial that we take action to restore them.</p>
                                <p>But the issue is complex – not all fires are bad and not all trees are good.</p>
                                <p>The consequences of inaction are dire: increased mass mortality, severe impacts on the climate, water scarcity, disruption of the California food system, and a significant threat to human health. To address the matter, it is necessary to engage policymakers, industries, funders, and the general public.</p>
                                <p>Our initial over-arching goal for this endeavor was to find ways to help increase the pace and scale of forest restoration in California (and eventually, the rest of the world). Our initial thinking about how we might achieve this task was to combine state-of-the-art spatial data (LIDAR), ultra-high-resolution satellite data, and user-friendly interfaces to make sense of the data. Although not incorrect, the needs were actually much more profound.</p>
