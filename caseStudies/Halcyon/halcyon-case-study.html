                            <p>The scale of the challenge is staggering. As Nat Bullard, Halcyon's Chief Strategy
                                Officer, puts it: <em>"Globally, we need just under $200 trillion invested in the next
                                    three decades
                                    to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. In 2023, we invested $1.8 trillion.
                                    Deploying that money is a capital markets challenge, but it is also a technical,
                                    business strategy, planning, and regulatory challenge."</em><br><br>
                                The numbers back this up. According to the International Energy Agency, global energy
                                investment reached $2.4 trillion in 2022, with clean energy investments accounting for
                                over $1.7 trillion. This massive market is exactly what Halcyon is poised to serve.</p>

                            <p>Halcyon was founded in April 2023 by Bruce Falck, former head of Twitter's ad team. His
                                journey from building "incredible machines to serve ads" to serving the planet began
                                with a desire to make a positive impact. A conversation with Andrew Beebe at Obvious
                                Ventures, known for its "world positive investing," set Falck on the path that led to
                                Halcyon's creation.<br><br>
                                Initially exploring carbon trading markets, Falck's direction shifted after conducting
                                over 100 customer interviews. He identified a critical need: organizations were
                                struggling to navigate the energy transition efficiently.

                            <p>
                                The energy sector is laden with complexities. Professionals spend considerable time
                                sifting through vast amounts of regulatory and market data to make informed decisions.
                                Nat Bullard articulates the problem: <em>"Today's information landscape is opaque,
                                    fragmented, noisy, and ever-expanding. That is a source of intense frustration for
                                    any analyst in a strategy or policy role. But with emerging artificial intelligence
                                    capabilities, it is also an opportunity."</em><br><br>
                                The scale of this data challenge is mind-boggling. A study by IDC found that the volume
                                of data worldwide is expected to grow to 175 zettabytes by 2025, with a significant
                                portion related to energy and climate. This data explosion underscores the need for
                                advanced processing tools like Halcyon's platform.<br><br>
                                Falck emphasizes the potential impact: <em>"If we can help someone get to a good answer
                                    in two hours versus two days or two weeks, that's going to have a huge impact. The
                                    way I think about it is we're removing sand from the gears."</em><br><br>
                                Kei's involvement was instrumental in Halcyon's early development. Our team explored
                                concepts, created prototype product sketches, defined potential value propositions,
                                conducted market research and competitive analysis, and identified key pain points and
                                opportunities for potential customers.<br><br>
                                Reflecting on this phase, Falck notes;

                            <p>
                                Securing investment was a critical early milestone for Halcyon. Kei worked closely with
                                the team to shape the product vision and create a compelling investor narrative. We
                                developed user personas, market analysis, competitive landscape overviews, and custom
                                data visualizations.<br><br>
                                This collaborative effort resulted in Halcyon securing $10 million in seed funding,
                                providing the resources needed to turn the concept into reality. This funding success is
                                particularly noteworthy given the challenges in the energy investment landscape. A
                                survey by the World Economic Forum found that 40% of energy industry executives cite
                                regulatory uncertainty as a major barrier to investment in clean energy. Halcyon's
                                platform, designed to navigate these complex regulatory landscapes, clearly resonated
                                with investors.

                                strategy. Kei led a process that included interviews with company founders,
                                stakeholders, and investors to understand the opportunities, shared beliefs, and
                                commonalities. <br><br>
                                "We kind of lacked ambition and imagination for what this thing could be," Falck admits.
                                The work reshaped the team's perception of their mission and potential. <br><br>Our goal
                                was to establish Halcyon as the trusted technology partner and leading information
                                platform in the energy transition ecosystem while leaving latitude to potentially expand
                                to additional market segments in the future. This strategy was crucial in positioning
                                Halcyon to address a market that Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects will reach $2.1

                            <p> We created a full visual identity system, including a corporate identity logomark, color
                                palette, typography, iconography, illustration style, and photography direction. Our
                                visual identity system was designed to be both distinctive and flexible, capable of
                                evolving with Halcyon's growth. We created a dynamic logomark that symbolized Halcyon's
                                role in synthesizing complex data into clear insights.<br><br>
                                We staged the work over a myriad of customer touchpoints and extended the system to
                                Halcyon's marketing website. We didn't just deliver guidelines; we partnered with
                                Halcyon to implement the new brand across all touchpoints. This included redesigning
                                their digital platforms, creating engaging presentation templates, and developing a
                                library of custom illustrations and visualizations. The result was a cohesive brand
                                experience that significantly elevated Halcyon's market presence and perceived
                                value.<br><br>

                                Artificial intelligence plays a central role in Halcyon's offerings. The company employs
                                large language models (LLMs) and generative AI to process and interpret vast amounts of
                                unstructured data.<br><br>
                                Bullard explains in a blog post, <em>"LLMs allow us to ask questions and get responses
                                    in human language. They make our work happen in a way that it could not before,
                                    allowing us to do something with software that would have been extremely expensive
                                    or impossible to do only with humans."</em><br><br>
                                Halcyon goes beyond basic AI use, using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
                                LLMs in specific knowledge areas, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses.
                                This technique is crucial for dealing with specialized areas such as regulatory policies
                                and energy transition information.<br><br>

                                felt familiar but provided UI for a completely new type of information retrieval system.
                                We needed to provide industry experts with a high degree of information scan-ability and

                                precise execution was critical in transforming Halcyon from an initial concept to a
                                fully-fledged, funded startup poised to make a significant impact in the climate tech

                            <p>Halcyon's journey from concept to execution offers a glimpse into the evolving landscape
                                of AI-enhanced data technology. As sectors converge and professionals from diverse
                                backgrounds pivot towards environmental solutions, Halcyon stands as a testament to the
                                potential of cross-industry innovation.<br><br>
                                The Halcyon project exemplifies Kei's model of engagement, where strategic design
                                thinking can shape a company from its very inception, creating positive ripple effects
                                that extend far beyond immediate project goals.<br><br>
                                In the race against climate change, every efficiency gained can have outsized impacts.
                                Halcyon's mission to make climate-related work more efficient and effective is a
                                testament to the power of holistic, strategic design in shaping not just companies, but

                                Challenges remain in the complex and rapidly evolving energy sector, with regulatory
                                landscapes shifting almost as quickly as the technology. Halcyon's success will depend
                                not only on its technical prowess but also on its ability to navigate these choppy
                                waters.<br><br>
                                As Halcyon continues to grow, the foundation laid by Kei positions the company for
