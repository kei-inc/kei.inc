                            <p>The last 40 years hasn’t been kind to small towns across the US. Almost every aspect of
                                life in rural areas has been under assault. Businesses are closing or have long closed,
                                main streets have been abandoned and buildings are falling apart, jobs are increasingly
                                scarce, housing stock is dwindling, and worst of all young people are giving up and not
                                coming back.</p>

                            <p>While that’s a rather bleak way to start a case study, there is hope! In the small town
                                of Humboldt Kansas there has been flurry of activity in the opposite direction; a group
                                of folks that have grabbed the reins of community development, determined to make their
                                town work.</p>
                            <p>Humboldt’s revitalization has taken the form of a new brewery, hotels, a campground,
                                bars, restaurants, a candy shop, a music venue, a garden school, a bookshop, ice cream

                            <p>This project is now known as A Bolder Humboldt, and started out in 2016 with the simple
                                statement: “let’s make the town we want to live in” but while the words were easy, the
                                path seemed unlikely. Conventional wisdom held that the challenges were almost
                                insurmountable; every business that left, every house torn down, and every civic
                                organization that was aging out had all happened for reasons–and none of those reasons
                                had changed.</p>
                            <p>Kei Partner, Paul Cloutier was one of those people–also a partner with ABH–working to
                                navigate the massive challenge of redesigning a community. This near life-long effort
                                gives us a front row seat to this work and a seat at the table to help contribute.</p>

                            <p>There has–for much of the second half of the 20th century until now–been a familiar model
                                for town revitalization that is often led by municipalities and main street orgs, that
                                takes a top down incentive-driven approach. The problem with this has always been a
                                disconnect from strategy and execution; the money people commission outsiders to have
                                ideas, and then tell locals to execute. The first innovation that we settled on with A
                                Bolder Humboldt was to flatten that strategy and execution into a process that can best
                                be described as "Strategic Action"; working in such a way that would allow us to build
                                and assess, build and assess. This allowed us to learn what was necessary as we went and
                                adjust based on what was working. Taking lessons from lean startups and applying it to
                                buildings and towns has been a real accelerant to town making.</p>
                            <p>It was this initial effort of building small that began to erode the skepticism of what
                                was possible. Seeing something done was like a spark in dry tinder, and a small fire of
                                enthusiasm started quickly.</p>

                            <p>But it’s not all just rolling up our sleeves, we had to develop a sense of ambition and
                                direction as well as giving us a sense of how to prioritize. The team often says that
                                while ABH is an organization, it is more importantly a vision, describing the nature of
                                what a bolder version of our town could be. This vision describes our sense of purpose,
                                the projects we believe we deserve, and a spirit of the people that we try to attract
                                and hold on to.</p>
                            <p>The vision is best represented by the town itself, while we have created plans, and

                            <p>It has been said that Kansas's greatest export is its young people. But while rural
                                areas are losing people, cities and dense urban areas are increasingly too costly for
                                creative people to take risks. Opening a restaurant or becoming a furniture maker are
                                almost completely out of reach of most people there. Right in the middle of the strategy
                                for revitalizing Humboldt is the belief that if you are young, creative and ambitious
                                there is no better place for you. As Cloutier said in the Kansas City Star, “You can be
                                ambitious and have dreams here at a reasonable scale. You want to be an artist? Come to
                                rural America. You can dedicate almost all your time to making cool stuff happen,
                                without having to run on the treadmill of keeping up in a larger city.” Developing
                                recruiting tools and a core marketing narrative to attract these people has seen
                                success, bringing critical members and workers to town. At a small scale, it doesn’t
                                take much to make a real difference.</p>

                            <p>An original principle for this project was that in order to be able to compete with
                                the
                                larger formula and chain businesses was to offer something that they could not or
                                would
                                not. Our belief was that creating something that felt unique and quality–something
                                you
                                could only get in Humboldt has driven most of the design decisions. Too often the
                                answer
                                to fading opportunity to to scale back, to diminish the experience rather than
                                invest
                                further, and the team fundamentally rejected that idea–how could we get people to
                                stick
                                around and spend more money if we were slowly getting worse. So every project has
                                invested heavily in brand experience, from custom wallpaper, to recrafted mosaic
                                tile
                                entrances, to neon signage, to custom scent generators, to all manner of branded
                                products for each property. The goal has been to create something that at least
                                feels
                                competitive with the biggest cities’ experiences but more importantly can only be
                                had if
                                you come to Humboldt. An era where more and more consolidation of brands is
                                happening
                                and a standardization of what things feel like has created a template driven city,
                                and
                                the only answer is to create a destination that bucks those trends.</p>

                            <p>In the spirit of being a destination, too many towns have given up their sense of place,
                                the qualities that make them unique based on their local materials, culture and
                                traditions. Travelers to places like San Francisco, New York and Kyoto, know that those
                                places are defined by their redwood victorians, their brownstones, their temple
                                architecture. And so it was with this in mind that we defined the "Humboldt Vernacular”,
                                a style guide of sorts that is inspired by local materials that we can use and reuse to
                                create a sense of place.<br><br>
                                The Humboldt Vernacular draws on the town's rich material inheritance, from the home
                                grown Black Walnut, locally quarried limestone, Humboldt’s history with brick making, a
                                local concrete plant, and the metal working tradition that comes from B&W, a beloved
                                Humboldt manufacturer. These have all led to our regular use of walnut lumber, COR-TEN
                                patina steel, limestone facades, and brick. In one way or another every project has
                                included a discussion and consideration of how to create something that pushes the
                                boundaries of what is possible while still considering what will fit in.<br><br>
                                Next up in this effort is the unified town branding system and wayfinding that helps
                                people navigate the trails and tie together all of the disparate visual systems from
                                numerous groups that need to communicate as one “Voice of Humboldt"

                                like Humboldt means rebuilding much of the entire food ecosystem, from farm, to packing,

                                hospitality training at a scale that hasn’t existed in generations here. And bringing
                                workers and entrepreneurs to town is held back by housing that has been neglected for
                                years in a market that can’t yet support new construction. So, this means much of the
                                work that starts with a desired outcome means tracking back to a root cause and
                                realizing your desire to open a bar means you have to write ballot language and get the
                                whole county to vote to change the laws first.</p>

                            <p>An early lesson added into the toolkit has been what we termed the “lean-to business”.
                                This is has meant placing a few ideas together under one roof to help prototype ideas
                                before we spin them out into their own spaces with their own staff. Putting a local
                                products mercantile in in the coffee shop allowed a certain amount of experimentation
                                while leveraging the shared overhead, preexisting sales people, and the steady flow of
                                traffic that otherwise might have been challenging. Or putting a small record shop in
                                the book store that if successful can be spun out into its own space, and if not then it
                                can just stay as a smaller “experience” in the book store.</p>

                            <p>One of the great challenges our civilization faces is an increasing feeling of distance
                                from each other. The lack of “third spaces” where people of different types and
                                backgrounds can gather has contributed to an increasing sense of loneliness and
                                isolation. Rebuilding these gathering spaces is one of the most important efforts in
                                this whole project. One of the very first steps of this project was to establish such a
                                place in the form of a coffee shop (a coffee shop now spun out of its lean-to business
                                model and called Octagon City Coffee). This space enabled local folks to “bump into”
                                each other, provided a gathering place for meetings and a beacon to visitors that there
                                was a “there there” to meet the locals. Since then the creation of the brewery, bars,
                                restaurants and live music has created a vibrant social scene in town attracting both
                                locals and visitors alike. The palpable sense of activity–with groups of people bar
                                hopping and coming to down for dinner and music–on a weekend night is a radical shift
                                from the previous emptiness.

                                revitalization isn't just about economic development. It's about creating a
                                sense of
                                place, fostering community pride, and building an ecosystem where people want to

                            <p>As Humboldt enters the next phase of its journey, the town stands as a testament
                                to
                                what's possible when visionary thinking meets strategic execution. Kansas

                                Laura
                                Kelly praised the initiative, stating, "There's no better example of the growth
                                and
                                success we're seeing in Kansas than in places like Humboldt."</p>
                            <p>For Kei, the Humboldt project represents a new frontier in their work. "What
                                we've
                                done
                                here goes beyond traditional consulting or design work," Cloutier concludes.
                                "It's
                                about
                                reimagining what's possible for rural communities in the 21st century. And in
                                doing
                                so,
                                we're not just changing one town – we're creating a model that could help
                                revitalize
                                rural America."</p>
