                            <p>The last 40 years hasn’t been kind to small towns across the US. Almost every aspect of
                                life in rural areas has been under assault. Businesses are closing or have long closed,
                                main streets have been abandoned and buildings are falling apart, jobs are increasingly
                                scarce, housing stock is dwindling, and worst of all young people are giving up and not
                                coming back.</p>

                                of Humboldt Kansas there has been flurry of activity in the opposite direction; a group
                                of folks that have grabbed the reins of community development, determined to make their
                                town work.</p>
                            <p>Humboldt’s revitalization has taken the form of a new brewery, hotels, a campground,

                            <p>This project is now known as A Bolder Humboldt, and started out in 2016 with the simple
                                statement: “let’s make the town we want to live in” but while the words were easy, the
                                path seemed unlikely. Conventional wisdom held that the challenges were almost
                                insurmountable; every business that left, every house torn down, and every civic
                                organization that was aging out had all happened for reasons–and none of those reasons
                                had changed.</p>
                            <p>Kei Partner, Paul Cloutier was one of those people–also a partner with ABH–working to
                                navigate the massive challenge of redesigning a community. This near life-long effort
                                gives us a front row seat to this work and a seat at the table to help contribute.</p>

                            <p>There has–for much of the second half of the 20th century until now–been a familiar model
                                for town revitalization, that is often led by municipalities and main street orgs, that
                                takes a top down incentive-driven approach. The problem with this has always been a
                                disconnect from strategy and execution, the money people commission outsiders to have
                                ideas, and then tell locals to execute. The first innovation that we settled on with A
                                Bolder Humboldt was to flatten that strategy and execution into a process that can best
                                be described as “Creative Action”; working in such a way that would allow us to build
                                and assess, build and assess. This allowed us to learn what was necessary as we went and
                                adjust based on what was working. Taking lessons from lean startups and applying it to
                                buildings and towns has been a real accelerant to town making.</p>
                            <p>It was this initial effort of building small that began to erode the skepticism of what
                                was possible. Seeing something done was like a spark in dry tinder, and a small fire of
                                enthusiasm started quickly.</p>

                            <p>But it’s not all just rolling up our sleeves, we had to develop a sense of ambition and
                                direction as well as giving us a sense of how to prioritize. The team often says that
                                while ABH is an organization, it is more importantly a vision, describing the nature of
                                what a bolder version of our town could be. This vision describes our sense of purpose,
                                the projects we believe we deserve, and a spirit of the people that we try to attract
                                and hold on to.</p>
                            <p>The vision is best represented by the town itself, while we have created plans, and
                                documents, and strategies, the best way to engage with what could be is to explore what
                                is, spending time in the place and with the people. And so we have created a very
                                immersive process of...</p>
                            <p>The real innovation here is this purpose driven approach. The truth is that

                            <p>An original principle for this project was that in order to be able to compete with the
                                larger formula and chain businesses was to offer something that they could not or would
                                not. Our belief was that creating something that felt unique and quality–something you
                                could only get in Humboldt has driven most of the design decisions. Too often the answer
                                to fading opportunity to to scale back, to diminish the experience rather than invest
                                further, and the team fundamentally rejected that idea–how could we get people to stick
                                around and spend more money if we were slowly getting worse. So every project has
                                invested heavily in brand experience, from custom wallpaper, to recrafted mosaic tile
                                entrances, to neon signage, to custom scent generators, to all manner of branded
                                products for each property. The goal has been to create something that at least feels
                                competitive with the biggest cities’ experiences but more importantly can only be had if
                                you come to Humboldt. An era where more and more consolidation of brands is happening
                                and a standardization of what things feel like has created a template driven city, and
                                the only answer is to create a destination that bucks those trends.</p>

                                Too many towns have given up their sense of place, the qualities that make them unique based on their local materials, culture and traditions. Travelers to places like San Francisco, New York and Kyoto, know that those places are defined by their redwood victorians, their brownstones, their temple architecture. And so it was with this in mind that we defined the "Humboldt Vernacular" A style guide of sorts that is inspired by local materials that we can use and reuse to create a sense of place.<br><br>
                                The Humboldt Vernacular draws on the town's rich architectural heritage, incorporating elements like locally-sourced limestone, traditional craftsmanship, and design motifs that reflect the town's history and natural surroundings. This distinctive style is applied consistently across new developments and renovations, creating a cohesive visual identity that sets Humboldt apart from other small towns.<br><br>
                                A unified branding system and wayfinding network complements this architectural approach, making it easy for visitors to navigate the town while reinforcing Humboldt's unique character at every turn.<br><br>

In 2022, The New York Times named Humboldt one of "52 Places for a Changed World," recognizing its innovative approach to rural revitalization. Other notable recognition includes:

                                <p>This recognition has brought new opportunities and challenges. Cole Herder, Humboldt's City Administrator, reflected on the transformation in an interview with the Kansas City Star: "The things that have happened in this town, I could never have dreamed of it."
                                    Humboldt's story offers valuable lessons for other rural communities facing similar challenges. Cloutier reflects, "What we've learned is that successful rural revitalization isn't just about economic development. It's about creating a sense of place, fostering community pride, and building an ecosystem where people want to live, work, and visit."</p>
