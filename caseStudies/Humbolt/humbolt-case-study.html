                        <p>The last 40 years hasn’t been kind to small towns across the US. Almost every aspect of life in rural areas has been under assault. Businesses are closing or have long closed, main streets have been abandoned and buildings are falling apart, jobs are increasingly scarce, housing stock is dwindling, and worst of all young people are giving up and not coming back.</p>
                        <p>While that’s a rather bleak way to start a case study, there is hope! In the small town of Humboldt Kansas there has been flurry of activity in the opposite direction; a group of folks that have grabbed the reins of community development, determined to make their town work.</p>
                        <p>Humboldt’s revitalization has taken the form of a new brewery, hotels, a campground, bars, restaurants, a candy shop, a music venue, a garden school, a bookshop, ice cream shop a shave ice stand, parks, trails, signage, and more at an accelerating pace.</p>

                        <p class="section-subtitle">Action Removes Doubt</p>
                        <p>This project is now known as A Bolder Humboldt, and started out in 2016 with the simple statement: “let’s make the town we want to live in” but while the words were easy, the path seemed unlikely. Conventional wisdom held that the challenges were almost insurmountable; every business that left, every house torn down, and every civic organization that was aging out had all happened for reasons–and none of those reasons had changed.</p>
                        <p>Kei Partner, Paul Cloutier was one of those people–also a partner with ABH–working to navigate the massive challenge of redesigning a community. This near life-long effort gives us a front row seat to this work and a seat at the table to help contribute.</p>
                        <p>There has–for much of the second half of the 20th century until now–been a familiar model for town revitalization, that is often led by municipalities and main street orgs, that takes a top down incentive-driven approach. The problem with this has always been a disconnect from strategy and execution, the money people commission outsiders to have ideas, and then tell locals to execute. The first innovation that we settled on with A Bolder Humboldt was to flatten that strategy and execution into a process that can best be described as “Creative Action”; working in such a way that would allow us to build and assess, build and assess. This allowed us to learn what was necessary as we went and adjust based on what was working. Taking lessons from lean startups and applying it to buildings and towns has been a real accelerant to town making.</p>
                        <p>It was this initial effort of building small that began to erode the skepticism of what was possible. Seeing something done was like a spark in dry tinder, and a small fire of enthusiasm started quickly.</p>

                        <p>But it’s not all just rolling up our sleeves, we had to develop a sense of ambition and direction as well as giving us a sense of how to prioritize. The team often says that while ABH is an organization, it is more importantly a vision, describing the nature of what a bolder version of our town could be. This vision describes our sense of purpose, the projects we believe we deserve, and a spirit of the people that we try to attract and hold on to.</p>
                        <p>The vision is best represented by the town itself, while we have created plans, and documents, and strategies, the best way to engage with what could be is to explore what is, spending time in the place and with the people. And so we have created a very immersive process of...</p>
                        <p>The real innovation here is this purpose driven approach. The truth is that revitalization projects like this are often done in a very piecemeal way, we have a building that needs to go...</p>
                        <p>The organization was designed to work as 3 pillars:</p>

                            <li><strong>Commercial Development</strong> - a for profit development arm; purchasing, restoring and leasing buildings, with the goal of getting the town back in fighting shape.</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic Development</strong> - a non-profit economic development arm; starting businesses, helping others start businesses in town. Marketing, design, planning, architecture, and build support. with the goal of leveling the commercial playing field.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Development</strong> - and a non-profit community development arm; helping with grant writing, community events, social planning with the goal of working to bind people to the place emotionally.</li>

                        <p>It has been said that Kansas’s greatest export is it’s young people. But while rural areas are losing people, cities and dense urban areas are increasingly too costly for creative people to take risks. Opening a restaurant or becoming a furniture maker are almost completely out of reach of most people there.</p>

                        <p>An original principle for this project was that in order to be able to compete with the larger formula and chain businesses was to offer something that they could not or would not. Our belief was that creating something that felt unique and quality–something you could only get in Humboldt has driven most of the design decisions. Too often the answer to fading opportunity to to scale back, to diminish the experience rather than invest further, and the team fundamentally rejected that idea–how could we get people to stick around and spend more money if we were slowly getting worse. So every project has invested heavily in brand experience, from custom wallpaper, to recrafted mosaic tile entrances, to neon signage, to custom scent generators, to all manner of branded products for each property. The goal has been to create something that at least feels competitive with the biggest cities’ experiences but more importantly can only be had if you come to Humboldt. An era where more and more consolidation of brands is happening and a standardization of what things feel like has created a template driven city, and the only answer is to create a destination that bucks those trends.</p>

And so it was with this in mind that we defined the “Humboldt Vernacular” A style guide of sorts that is inspired by local materials that we can use and reuse to create a sense of place.

                        <p>To trade on the metaphor of restarting the economic “engine” of a place for a moment, we approached many of the problems with the idea of a flywheel in mind. If we have areas of momentum we work to map out the opportunities that can take advantage of that momentum as well as further spin them up.</p>
                        <p>This process starts with identifying those flywheels and then mapping out how they are being supported and where there are gaps in experience. The first flywheels have been:</p>

                        <p>As Humboldt's transformation gained momentum, it began to attract attention beyond its borders. In 2022, The New York Times named Humboldt one of "52 Places for a Changed World," recognizing its innovative approach to rural revitalization.</p>
                        <p>This recognition has brought new opportunities and challenges. Cole Herder, Humboldt's City Administrator, reflected on the transformation in an interview with the Kansas City Star: "The things that have happened in this town, I could never have dreamed of it."</p>
                        <p>Humboldt's story offers valuable lessons for other rural communities facing similar challenges. Cloutier reflects, "What we've learned is that successful rural revitalization isn't just about economic development. It's about creating a sense of place, fostering community pride, and building an ecosystem where people want to live, work, and visit."</p>

                        <p>As Humboldt enters the next phase of its journey, the town stands as a testament to what's possible when visionary thinking meets strategic execution. Kansas Governor Laura Kelly praised the initiative, stating, "There's no better example of the growth and success we're seeing in Kansas than in places like Humboldt."</p>
                        <p>For Kei, the Humboldt project represents a new frontier in their work. "What we've done here goes beyond traditional consulting or design work," Cloutier concludes. "It's about reimagining what's possible for rural communities in the 21st century. And in doing so, we're not just changing one town – we're creating a model that could help revitalize rural America."</p>
