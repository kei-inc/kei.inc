                            <p>In the rapidly evolving world of corporate communica-tions, Business Wire, a
                                long-standing leader in press release distribution, recognized the need for a
                                significant shift. The team at Kei was engaged to help Business Wire navigate this
                                transformation, moving from a traditional PR service provider to a comprehensive, modern
                                commu-nications ecosystem.

                            <p>The Kei team began by assessing the current state of the communications industry. "The
                                media world is evolving rapidly," noted Kevin Farnham, one of Kei's partners. "Much of
                                the content people consume now exists outside the traditional print and broadcast
                                structure."<br><br>
                                This shift has created a complex web of challenges for communications professionals:</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px;">According to the Pew Research Center's 2023
                            report, newsroom employment in the U.S. has continued to decline, with a 26% drop between
                            2008 and 2022. This trend has accelerated, with a 4% decline just between 2020 and 2022.</p>

                            journalists receive 11-100 press releases daily, emphasizing the need for PR tools that can

                                platforms. The challenge was clear: Business Wire needed to do more than just keep
                                pace—it needed to redefine the industry itself.</p>

                                agencies, and influencers. This human-centered approach revealed a clear need: an

                                media contacts to creating content and measuring success.</p>
