                        <p class="section-subtitle">Reimagining Retail: Kei's Transformative Partnership with Macy's</p>
                        <p >In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, few names carry the weight and history of Macy's. For over a century, the iconic department store has been a cornerstone of American shopping culture. But as the digital revolution swept through the industry, even this retail giant found itself at a crossroads. Facing challenges from e-commerce disruptors, changing consumer behaviors, and the burden of an extensive physical footprint, Macy's needed more than incremental change—it needed a complete reimagining of its future.</p>
                        <p >Enter Kei, a strategic creative agency known for its holistic approach to complex business challenges. In a partnership that would span nearly two years, Kei embarked on an ambitious journey to help Macy's bridge the gap between its storied past and a digital-first future. This case study explores how Kei's unique methodology, rooted in systems thinking and strategic-to-tactical execution, helped shape a new vision for one of America's most beloved retail brands.</p>

                        <p class="section-subtitle">The Challenge: A Retail Giant at a Crossroads</p>
                        <p >As Kei partner Paul Cloutier recalls, "Macy's was facing the obvious stuff. They had been this dominant force in retail for over 100 years. They had an incredible retail footprint, physical retail footprint, and a huge amount of physical real estate that they sort of owned or managed, and the cost of that was ballooning at a time when suddenly more and more people were shopping online."</p>
                        <p >The challenges were multifaceted:</p>
                        <ul >
                            <li>E-commerce disruption: Competition from Amazon and unexpected players like Instagram and Stitch Fix was eroding Macy's market share.</li>
                            <li>Operational complexity: With over 200,000 retail employees, Macy's struggled to maintain consistent service quality across locations.</li>
                            <li>Brand perception: Macy's had developed a reputation as a value brand, with customers often waiting for sales and using coupons, reducing urgency to buy.</li>
                            <li>Digital transformation: The need to integrate digital experiences with physical retail in a seamless, customer-centric way.</li>
                            <li>Organizational silos: Different departments within Macy's often operated independently, making cohesive innovation difficult.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p >Despite these challenges, Macy's leadership recognized a unique opportunity. As Cloutier explains, "There was this belief that as a department store, they still had something special, some relevance, that they could provide value to you at different points in your life."</p>
                        <p >The opportunity lay in reimagining Macy's role in customers' lives—from being a place to buy things to becoming a trusted partner throughout various life stages and experiences.</p>

                        <p class="section-subtitle">Kei's Approach: Systems Thinking Meets Retail Innovation</p>
                        <p >Recognizing the complexity of the challenge, Macy's sought a partner that could bring fresh perspective while deeply understanding the organization's inner workings. They found that partner in Kei.</p>
                        <p >Our approach was fundamentally different from traditional consulting engagements. Rather than parachuting in with pre-baked solutions, Kei embedded itself within Macy's, creating a hybrid internal-external team that could navigate the organization's complexities while maintaining an outsider's perspective.</p>
                        <p >The project unfolded in several key phases:</p>
                        <p class="body-Copy-Title">Immersive Discovery and Innovation Lab (Year 1)</p>
                        <p >We began by establishing a nimble, cross-functional team that would serve as an innovation hub within Macy's. This team, initially consisting of just two team members, set up shop in an empty Macy's-owned building in downtown San Francisco.</p>
                        <p >The first six months were dedicated to intensive collaboration with various Macy's teams. As Cloutier describes, "We would build teams. So we're like, alright, let's go get people from the loyalty team. And we're going to spend basically a week to two weeks with four people from the loyalty team, and we're going to hole up in this conference room, and we're going to talk about all the challenges that you're facing, what you've done in the past, what failed in the past. And then we're going to spend some of that time just thinking, like, what if? What could it be?"</p>
                        <p >This process was repeated across departments, including fashion, cosmetics, menswear, housewares, wedding registry, and more. The Kei team also engaged with operational teams like e-commerce, wayfinding, and corporate strategy.</p>
                        <p >Key elements of this phase included:</p>
                        <ul >
                            <li>Rapid prototyping and in-store testing: The team developed quick prototypes and tested them with real customers in Macy's stores, gathering immediate, actionable feedback.</li>
                            <li>Comprehensive research: Alongside hands-on work, Kei conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative research on the future of retail, drawing from sources like Forrester and conducting original studies.</li>
                            <li>Cross-pollination of ideas: By bringing together team members from various departments, Kei fostered connections and ideas that might not have emerged otherwise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="body-Copy-Title">Strategy Development and Service Blueprint Creation</p>
                        <p >As insights accumulated, Kei synthesized them into a comprehensive strategy document and service blueprint. This "galaxy of opportunity," as Cloutier calls it, became a guiding star for the project's next phases.</p>
                        <p >The service blueprint was technology-agnostic, focusing instead on customer needs and expectations across various touchpoints. This holistic view allowed Macy's to consider solutions beyond the constraints of existing systems or organizational structures.</p>
                        <p class="body-Copy-Title">Concept Development and Visualization (6-9 months)</p>
                        <p >With the strategy in place, Kei shifted focus to bringing ideas to life. This phase involved:</p>
                        <ul >
                            <li>Experience principles development: Kei created a set of guiding principles for Macy's future experiences, such as leveraging data to reduce customer effort and enhancing social integration.</li>
                            <li>Collaborative design sprints: Kei engaged Macy's internal design team in a series of sprints, fostering ownership and buy-in while pushing the boundaries of what was possible.</li>
                            <li>High-fidelity prototypes: The team created detailed visual designs and prototypes that looked and felt like real, launchable products.</li>
                            <li>Vision video creation: To communicate the full scope of possibilities, Kei produced a video showcasing the reimagined Macy's experience. This video served multiple purposes, from executive buy-in to vendor engagement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p >Throughout this process, we maintained a delicate balance between pushing for innovation and respecting the expertise of Macy's internal teams. As Cloutier notes, "It was a constant effort to build these relationships because we were effectively operating as consultants, but we were operating internally."</p>

                        <p >The collaboration yielded several tangible and intangible outcomes:</p>
                        <ul >
                            <li>Actionable Innovation: Many ideas from the project were immediately implemented by various Macy's teams, including in-store wayfinding and enhanced use of customer data.</li>
                            <li>Long-term Vision: The comprehensive strategy document and vision video became a rallying point for the entire organization, providing direction and inspiration for years to come.</li>
                            <li>Organizational Alignment: By involving team members from across Macy's, the project fostered greater cross-departmental understanding and collaboration.</li>
                            <li>Cultural Shift: The project helped instill a more innovative, customer-centric mindset throughout Macy's.</li>
                            <li>Career Development: Several Macy's team members who participated in the project went on to build successful careers within the company, leveraging the experience and insights gained.</li>
                            <li>Tangible Products: Some concepts were developed into real products, such as the Herald Square app, which used advanced indoor navigation to help customers find their way through Macy's flagship 2-million-square-foot store.</li>

                            <li>The Power of Hybrid Teams: By operating as both insiders and outsiders, Kei was able to navigate organizational complexities while maintaining fresh perspective.</li>
                            <li>Rapid Validation is Key: The ability to quickly test ideas with real customers in-store proved invaluable in refining concepts and building confidence in new approaches.</li>
                            <li>Vision as a Unifying Force: The creation of a compelling, tangible vision helped align diverse stakeholders and inspire action across the organization.</li>
                            <li>Systems Thinking is Essential: Understanding the interconnections between various departments and challenges was crucial in developing holistic, effective solutions.</li>
                            <li>Empowering Internal Champions: By involving and elevating internal team members, Kei ensured that the project's impact would continue long after their direct involvement ended.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p >While Macy's has faced significant challenges in the years since this project, including financial pressures and market disruptions, the work done with Kei continues to influence the company's approach to innovation and customer experience.</p>
                        <p >As retail continues to evolve, the lessons from this collaboration remain relevant. The need for holistic, customer-centric thinking, rapid innovation, and seamless integration of digital and physical experiences has only grown more acute in the intervening years.</p>
                        <p >The Macy's project stands as a testament to the power of their approach—combining deep strategic thinking with hands-on execution, all while navigating the complex realities of a large, established organization. As retail and other industries continue to face disruptive change, the ability to reimagine entire systems while delivering tangible results will only become more valuable.</p>
                        <p >In reflection, Cloutier encapsulates the project's lasting impact: "It was a very interesting project. Obviously, tons of wildly useful lessons learned about how you engage with internal teams, how you build something where you're not just dropping some agency's bullshit on top of an internal team that's been working hard on something for a long time... The idea of rapid validation was incredibly core to this. And really meaningful to, like, come up with an idea and go talk to actual customers downstairs was incredible."</p>
                        <p >As Macy's and the retail industry at large continue to evolve, the innovative spirit and systems-level thinking exemplified in this project serve as a blueprint for how established companies can reimagine themselves for a rapidly changing future.</p>
