                            <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, few names carry the weight and history of
                                Macy's. For over a century, the iconic department store has been a cornerstone of
                                American shopping culture. But as the digital revolution swept through the industry,
                                even this retail giant found itself at a crossroads. The challenges were stark: UBS
                                reports that the number of U.S. department stores has declined by 60% since 2000, from
                                8,600 to around 3,440 in 2022. Facing this industry-wide contraction, along with
                                challenges from e-commerce disruptors, changing consumer behaviors, and the burden of an
                                extensive physical footprint, Macy's needed more than incremental change—it needed a
                                complete reimagining of its future. </p>
                            <p>In a partnership that would span nearly two years, we embarked on an ambitious journey to
                                help Macy's bridge the gap between its storied past and a digital-first future.</p>

                            <p>As Kei partner Paul Cloutier recalls, "Macy's was facing the obvious stuff. They had been
                                this dominant force in retail for over 100 years. They had an incredible retail
                                footprint, physical retail footprint, and a huge amount of physical real estate that
                                they sort of owned or managed, and the cost of that was ballooning at a time when
                                suddenly more and more people were shopping online."</p>
                            <p>The challenges were multifaceted:</p>

                        <p style="color: #BB3216;">Macy's had developed a reputation as a value brand, with customers
                            often waiting for sales and using coupons, reducing urgency to buy.

                        <p style="color: #BB3216;">Different departments within Macy's often operated independently,
                            making cohesive innovation difficult.

                            <p> Despite these challenges, Macy's leadership recognized a unique opportunity. As Cloutier
                                explains, "There was this belief that as a department store, they still had something
                                special, some relevance, that they could provide value to you at different points in
                                your life."<br><br>
                                The opportunity lay in reimagining Macy's role in customers' lives—from being a place to
                                buy things to becoming a trusted partner throughout various life stages and experiences.

                            <p>Recognizing the complexity of the challenge, this project required a new type of approach
                                that got us past the traditional consultancy model of external experts. Rather than
                                parachuting in with pre-baked solutions, We were embedded as a team within Macy's,
                                creating a hybrid internal-external team that could navigate the organization's
                                complexities while maintaining an outsider's perspective.<br><br>
                                The project unfolded in several key phases:</p>
                            <p class="body-Copy-Title">Immersive Discovery and Innovation Lab</p>
                            <p>We began by establishing a nimble, cross-functional team that would serve as an
                                innovation hub within Macy's. This team, initially consisting of just two team members,
                                set up shop in an empty Macy's-owned building in downtown San Francisco.<br><br>
                                The first six months were dedicated to intensive collaboration with various Macy's
                                teams. As Cloutier describes, "We would build teams. So we're like, alright, let's go
                                get people from the loyalty team. And we're going to spend basically a week to two weeks
                                with four people from the loyalty team, and we're going to hole up in this conference
                                room, and we're going to talk about all the challenges that you're facing, what you've
                                done in the past, what failed in the past. And then we're going to spend some of that
                                time just thinking, like, what if? What could it be?"<br><br>

                                housewares, wedding registry, and more. The Kei team also engaged with operational teams

                            <p>While Macy's has faced significant challenges in the years since this project, including
                                financial pressures and market disruptions, the work done with Kei continues to
                                influence the company's approach to innovation and customer experience. <br><br>
                                As retail continues to evolve, the lessons from this collaboration remain relevant. The
                                need for holistic, customer-centric thinking, rapid innovation, and seamless integration
                                of digital and physical experiences has only grown more acute in the intervening years.
                                <br><br>
                                The Macy's project stands as a testament to the power of Kei's approach—com-bining deep
                                strategic thinking with hands-on execution, all while navigating the complex realities
                                of a large, established organization. As retail and other industries continue to face
                                disruptive change, the ability to reimagine entire systems while delivering tangible
                                results will only become more valuable.<br><br>
                                In reflection, Cloutier encapsulates the project's lasting impact: "It was a very
                                interesting project. Obviously, tons of wildly useful lessons learned about how you
                                engage with internal teams, how you build something where you're not just dropping some
                                agency's bullshit on top of an internal team that's been working hard on something for a
                                long time... The idea of rapid validation was incredibly core to this. And really
                                meaningful to, like, come up with an idea and go talk to actual customers downstairs was
                                incredible."<br><br>
                                As Macy's and the retail industry at large continue to evolve, the innovative spirit and
                                systems-level thinking exemplified in this project serve as a blueprint for how
                                established companies can reimagine themselves for a rapidly changing future.
