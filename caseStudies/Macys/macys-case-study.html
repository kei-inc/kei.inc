                            <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, few names carry the weight and history of
                                Macy's. For over a century, the iconic department store has been a cornerstone of
                                American shopping culture. But as the digital revolution swept through the industry,
                                even this retail giant found itself at a crossroads. </p>

                            <p>The challenges were stark: UBS reports that the number of U.S. department stores has
                                declined by 60% since 2000, from 8,600 to around 3,440 in 2022. Facing this
                                industry-wide contraction, along with challenges from e-commerce disrup-tors, changing
                                consumer behaviors, and the burden of an extensive physical footprint, Macy's needed
                                more than incremental changeâ€”it needed a complete reimagining of its
                                future.<br><br>Enter Kei.
                                In a partnership that would span nearly two years, Kei embarked on an ambitious journey
                                to help Macy's bridge the gap between its storied past and a digital-first future.</p>

                            <p>As Kei partner Paul Cloutier recalls, "Macy's was facing the obvious stuff. They had been
                                this dominant force in retail for over 100 years. They had an incredible retail
                                footprint, physical retail footprint, and a huge amount of physical real estate that
                                they sort of owned or managed, and the cost of that was ballooning at a time when
                                suddenly more and more people were shopping online."</p>

                        <p style="color: #BB3216;">With over 200,000 retail employees, Macy's struggled to maintain

                        <p style="color: #BB3216;">Macy's had developed a reputation as a value brand, with customers
                            often waiting for sales and using coupons, reducing urgency to buy.

                        <p style="color: #BB3216;">Different departments within Macy's often operated independently,
                            making cohesive innovation difficult.

                            <p> Despite these challenges, Macy's leadership recognized a unique opportunity. As Cloutier
                                explains, "There was this belief that as a department store, they still had something
                                special, some relevance, that they could provide value to you at different points in
                                your life."<br><br>
                                The opportunity lay in reimagining Macy's role in customers' livesâ€”from being a place to
                                buy things to becoming a trusted partner throughout various life stages and experiences.

                            <p>Recognizing the complexity of the challenge, Macy's sought a partner that could bring
                                fresh perspective while deeply understanding the organization's inner workings. They
                                found that partner in Kei.<br><br>
                                Our approach was fundamentally different from traditional consulting engagements. Rather
                                than parachuting in with pre-baked solutions, Kei embedded itself within Macy's,
                                creating a hybrid internal-external team that could navigate the organization's
                                complexities while maintaining an outsider's perspective.<br><br>
                                The project unfolded in several key phases:</p>
                            <p class="body-Copy-Title">Immersive Discovery and Innovation Lab (Year 1)</p>
                            <p>We began by establishing a nimble, cross-functional team that would serve as an innovation hub within Macy's. This team, initially consisting of just two team members, set up shop in an empty Macy's-owned building in downtown San Francisco.<br><br>
                                The first six months were dedicated to intensive collaboration with various Macy's teams. As Cloutier describes, "We would build teams. So we're like, alright, let's go get people from the loyalty team. And we're going to spend basically a week to two weeks with four people from the loyalty team, and we're going to hole up in this conference room, and we're going to talk about all the challenges that you're facing, what you've done in the past, what failed in the past. And then we're going to spend some of that time just thinking, like, what if? What could it be?"<br><br>
                                This process was repeated across departments, including fashion, cosmetics, menswear, housewares, wedding registry, and more. The Kei team also engaged with operational teams like e-commerce, wayfinding, and corporate strategy.<br><br>
                                Key elements of this phase included:

                                The service blueprint was technology-agnostic, focusing instead on customer needs and expectations across various touchpoints. This holistic view allowed Macy's to consider solutions beyond the constraints of existing systems or organizational structures.
